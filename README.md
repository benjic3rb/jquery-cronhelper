# jquery-cronhelper
Tool made in JQuery to help users generate the cron frequency they need.
It generates classic Linux cron syntax according to user's inputs.

Initial work here : https://sotux.github.io/jquery-cron-quartz/

I just adapted the tool to work with classic cron syntax, as it used quartz cron syntax (which takes 2 more parameters);
